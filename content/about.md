I’m a data product owner at [GSK](https://www.gsk.com) with nearly two decades in clinical research, blending my passion for data analytics with experience across clinical performance monitoring, trial diversity analytics, site intelligence and commercial insights. My career path was forged out of a love for both numbers and languages. Graduating with First Class Honours in Languages from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk), I quickly pivoted into the life sciences sector, where I discovered that data, like language, needs “translating” for real impact.

Now, I specialize in crafting data products that turn complex information into actionable insights for business leaders. I leverage tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi), and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) to bridge the gap between data and decision-making, using an agile, user-focused approach to bring clarity and value. My goal is to help organizations not just understand data, but to see its strategic potential.
