For the past few years, I have been keeping a private, digital journal of photos with short text descriptions about what we have been up to as a family. Currently, I use an app called [Momento](https://momentoapp.com) for this, but I have been looking around for a better option. I have been trialling a product called [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) for a few days now and I believe it offers several significant advantages over Momento:

- **Multi-device support** - Momento is a phone-only app. I love that I can now access my journal from any of my devices, and even via a web browser.
- **Syncing** - backing up to the Day One cloud servers keeps my iCloud storage available for other things, like all of the photos I am taking.
- **Ability to share journals** - now I can share my journal with my husband.

Having seen the benefits that Day One can offer, my next step is to transfer all of my journal entries from Momento to Day One. Since there doesn't seem to be a help guide dedicated to this, I decided to document how I did this, in case it is helpful for anyone else.

# Before you start
Before you embark on importing any data into Day One you need to understand some basics. Day One has a [helpful guide](https://dayoneapp.com/guides/settings/importing-data-to-day-one/#MacOS) to importing

- Day One does provide an example of the required format for JSON imports [here](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/help_guides/importing-data-from-json-files/). The example they provide is pretty complex since it contains every possible element of a journal entry.
- Day One also provides an example of expected formate for CSV imports [here](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/help_guides/importing-data-from-csv/).
