      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspired by “Cubing from the Corner Office” by Meghan Walsh, published in Korn Ferry&amp;rsquo;s Briefings Magazine. You can read the original article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kornferry.com/insights/briefings-magazine/issue-66/cubing-from-the-corner-office?utm_source=allsoc&amp;amp;utm_medium=soc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=24-10-gbl-briefings-magazine&amp;amp;utm_content=briefings-article&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of business, we’re often faced with challenges that seem as intricate and tangled as a Rubik’s Cube. Emmanuel Pacheco, a sales executive at Google and Guinness World Record holder for solving the iconic puzzle, believes that the Cube offers more than just a mental workout — it’s a model for tackling complex business problems. In Meghan Walsh’s article, Pacheco shares that “everything is interdependent” when solving the Cube, and he draws a parallel to the interconnected nature of corporate decision-making. His approach has inspired leaders around the world to think differently about obstacles in the workplace, breaking them down into manageable steps and working within fixed constraints to achieve alignment and success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
