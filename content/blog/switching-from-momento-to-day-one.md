For the past few years, I've kept a private, digital journal filled with photos and stories about family life. I used an app called [Momento](https://momentoapp.com), but recently decided to switch to [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) because it offers me several advantages:

## Why choose **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}** over **{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}**?

| **Feature** | **{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}** | **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}** |
|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| **Supported devices** | Phone only (iOS or Android) | Multiple platform support |
| **Syncing** | No sync | Syncs to Day One cloud |
| **Sharing** | Not supported | Share journals with people you choose |

## Getting started

If you're considering making the same switch, here is a simple guide based on my own experience. My setup includes:

* iPhone 13 Pro running iOS 18.3.2
* MacBook Air M4 running macOS Sequoia 15.4
* **{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}** Premium subscription (see [note on Momento](#some-notes-on-momento) below)
* **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}** Premium subscription

## Step 1: Export your data from **{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}**

> *You'll need a premium subscription to **{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}** (or use the free trial month) in order to export your data.*

The basic process of exporting data from **{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}** is detailed in the [help pages](https://momento.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207965865-Export-FAQ). However, I found the instructions unclear in some places, so here are a few additional tips from me:

* Limit your exports to 5GB (try yearly batches if your data includes photos and videos)
* When you tap on **Create Export** the export file is generated and a link appears within the app like this:

{{< figure
  src="/img/momento-export-created.png"
  alt="An export that has been created through the Momento app"
  caption="Export file created in Momento app"
  align=center
  width=350
>}}

* Tap on the export file and you will be asked if you want to share it. Tap on **Share**.
* Choose the option to **Save to Files** and choose a location in your iPhone files to save it.
* Once you have saved the export file to your phone, you can transfer it to a laptop for further processing using AirDrop or your preferred method.

## Step 2: Prepare your data for **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}**

> *The text file generated by **{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}** needs to be converted to a format and structure that can be read by **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}**.*

**{{< colour "#c26c2e" >}}Momento{{< /colour >}}** exports your journal as a text (.txt) file that looks like this:

```

Today it was time for a trip to the museum.
At: Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, South Kensington (51.496727, -0.176484)
Media: 6EEB86F3-29C5-4D91-91F0-7CA5BA744230_original.jpg
```
This needs to be converted to a format that **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}** can import. I'd suggest using CSV if you don't need to include media (photos and videos) or JSON if you do.

### Tips for CSV

* The full list of accepted fields for CSV import can be found [here](https://forums.dayoneapp.com/forums/topic/csv-file-format/).
* `date` and `text` are the only required fields for the CSV import. All other fields are optional.
* `date` must be provided in ISO 8601 format, including 3 decimal places for milliseconds, like this: `2017-02-25T10:54:00.000Z`.

If you're comfortable with basic coding, I have shared an [R script on GitHub](https://github.com/clarelgibson/momento-to-day-one) that automates the conversion, using only the `date` and `text` fields.

## Step 3: Import data into **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}**

> ***{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}** imports will automatically be added to a new journal called Exports and must then be manually transferred to your journal of choice.*

The process for importing entries into **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}** is well described in the [help pages](https://dayoneapp.com/guides/settings/importing-data-to-day-one/) so I won't detail it here. Be aware that when you import entries they will be added to a new journal called **Export**. You can easily move them to your preferred journal within **{{< colour "#6fbef7" >}}Day One{{< /colour >}}**.

## Conclusion

Switching to a new journalling platform can seem like a daunting task, but the advantages of the new platform can make it a worthwhile upgrade. I hope that this guide simplifies the process for you.
