*This case study is my capstone submission to the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).*

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company operating in Chicago, US. To unlock growth, Cyclistic wants to launch a campaign to convert casual riders into subscribed members. This case study explores the different ways that casual riders and members use Cyclistic, and offers recommendations of actions that could be taken to encourage conversions.
